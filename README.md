This component lets admins embed iFrames by using a Lightning Component.
The component also lets them add the url, design attributes as well as a custom field to pass parameters to the url.

### Special thanks to

[nikitakarpenkov](https://github.com/nikitakarpenkov/iframe-lightning-component) and [jlondrejcka](https://github.com/jlondrejcka/LDS-Dynamic-Field-Input) as this component uses their code mainly and has only been slightly modified.
